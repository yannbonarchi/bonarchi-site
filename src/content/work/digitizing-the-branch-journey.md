## Context

A Central African bank with a network of 85+ branches. The customer journey was
still mostly analog. You walked in, took a ticket, waited, and only then started
explaining what you came to do. The teller keyed everything from scratch while
you stood there. The queue absorbed all of it, every day, in every branch.

## What I built

I worked on connecting the remote channel to the branch floor. A customer can
now initiate a transaction from their phone. By the time they reach the branch,
the request is already in the right queue, pre-filled, and linked to the bank's
core systems for real-time account verification. The teller validates instead of
re-typing.

The hard parts were the usual banking ones. Secure API integration with the core
platform. Real-time account verification. Making sure a request created remotely
and a person arriving physically reconcile to one event, never two. It shipped
through Docker, Kubernetes and CI/CD pipelines, so releases stayed controlled and
auditable, which is non-negotiable in a regulated environment.

## Impact

Client wait time dropped about 45 percent. Processing time per transaction
dropped about 40 percent. The customer waits less. The teller does less
mechanical entry and more of the judgment work only a person can do.

## What I took from it

This is the project that convinced me the highest-leverage software in a bank is
not the flashy app. It is the quiet plumbing that meets people where they already
are, on the phone in their hand, and respects the branch staff's time. A lot of
my current thinking started here.
